In this game you build your empire and must achieve your goals

Development is paused until the console version for my CS class is done, and enough experience is gathered with OpenGL. After, I will reuse the code for the graphical application, which will be built with OpenGL. 

UPDATE: v1.0 is out, AI development has just started, which means that until a functional AI/combat system is worked out, and most bugs are fixed, graphical version is being delayed.
